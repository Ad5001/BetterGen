            A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Author with the Software:    
                i. identification of the creator(s) of the Software and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Author (including by pseudonym if designated);

        b. You may satisfy the conditions in Section III(1)(a) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Distribute the Software.

        A. The Modification Author's License You apply must be the NTOS License
        B. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Modification's Author's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Distribute the Modification.

Section IV. Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Software:

    for the avoidance of doubt, Section II(1)(a) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Dstribute all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;
    if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is the Modification, including for purposes of Section III(2); and
    You must comply with the conditions in Section III(1) if You Distribute all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section IV supplements and does not replace Your obligations under the NTOS License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section V – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

    1. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Author, to the extent possible, the Author offers the Software as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Software, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
    2. To the extent possible, in no event will the Author be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of the NTOS License or use of the Software, even if the Author has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

    3. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.


Section VI – Term and Termination.

    The NTOS License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with the NTOS License, then Your rights under the NTOS License terminate automatically.

    Where Your right to use the Software has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
        automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
        upon express reinstatement by the Author.
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Author may have to seek remedies for Your violations of the NTOS License.
    For the avoidance of doubt, the Author may also offer the Software under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Software at any time; however, doing so will not terminate the NTOS License.
    Sections I, V, VI, VII, and VI survive termination of the NTOS License.

Section VII – Other Terms and Conditions.

    The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
    Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Software not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of the NTOS License.

Section VIII – Interpretation.

    For the avoidance of doubt, the NTOS License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Software that could lawfully be made without permission under the NTOS License.
    To the extent possible, if any provision of the NTOS License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from the NTOS License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
    No term or condition of the NTOS License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Author.
    Nothing in the NTOS License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Author or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

In case of a specific issue not specified in the NTOSL, Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which reserves all rights to the Author applies.
